## Howdy, I'm Alexandra ðŸŒ¼
(she/her)
I am currently completing my course in Computer Forensics & Security at SETU Waterford. While my primary passion lies in cybersecurity, Iâ€™m also deeply interested in law and legal principles, particularly in how they intersect with technology. I enjoy studying the defensive side of cybersecurity!  Currently , Im extremely interested in malware analysis and how specifically advanced malware detects that its in a sandbox environment. I'm currently researching ways to prevent that detection!
