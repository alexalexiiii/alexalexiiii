## Howdy, I'm Alexandra 🌼
(she/her)
I am currently completing my course in Computer Forensics & Security at SETU Waterford. While my primary passion lies in cybersecurity, I’m also deeply interested in law and legal principles, particularly in how they intersect with technology. I enjoy studying the defensive side of cybersecurity also! Particularly in relation to credential harvesting and defense evasion !
