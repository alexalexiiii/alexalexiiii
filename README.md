# Howdy, I'm Alexandra 🌼

(she/her)

I am currently completing my course in Computer Forensics & Security at SETU Waterford. While my primary passion lies in cybersecurity, I’m also deeply interested in law and legal principles, particularly in how they intersect with technology. I enjoy studying the defensive side of cybersecurity! Currently, I'm extremely interested in malware analysis and how advanced malware detects that it's in a sandbox environment. I'm currently researching ways to prevent that detection!
